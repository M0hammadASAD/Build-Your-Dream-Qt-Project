<h1>Build Your Dream ( A sample Qt C++ gui application) </h1>
<p>Hello Everyone. This repository is for the application "Build Your Dream" which is the first application developed by me.
This application is created for study purpose only (To be more specific, To learn the core concept of OOP). This application is created with Qt Framework. The required knowledges are: C++, SQL, CSS3 and little bit of Qt framework. :p<br>
This application is under development and may have bugs. I am working for fixing the bugs. I am still a newbie and this is my first attempt. Please, forgive and ignore
my mistakes. <br>
