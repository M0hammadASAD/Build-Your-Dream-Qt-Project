Hello Everyone,
</h1> <br>
<p> This is the beta version of my first application on Qt named as "Build Your Dream". I tried my best to make this application bug free. However, there could be some
bugs. I am working for a version update. Hope all the issue should be solved in next update.<br>
I am uploading the source files of this application on this repository and the executable file as well as.<br> Here are two folders in this directory. 
<br> <text align="center"><b>
1. Executable File<br>2. Source File </b> </text>
<br> "Executable File" folder is for the exe file. If you want to download and run this application on your Windows OS device
then you can find it here. Not that, it is only for 64-bit Windows Os devices.<br>
The other folder "Source File" is for source files. If you want to modify it further then you can access it here.<br>
<strong> Please, don't misuse it. Don't copy this project for your academic usage. </strong><br> Thank you </p>
